libqtlxqt - LXDE-Qt system integration plugin for Qt.

With this plugin, all Qt-based programs can adopt settings of
LXDE-Qt, such as the icon theme.

To let Qt load the plugin, export the environment variable
QT_PLATFORM_PLUGIN=lxqt or DESKTOP_SESSION=lxqt.
However, setting DESKTOP_SESSION might affect the behaviors
of other tools such as xdg-tools. If this is not the desired
effect, use QT_PLATFORM_PLUGIN.
